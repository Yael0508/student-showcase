# Hello!

My Name is **Jonathan Kemp**.
My passion is to understand the world and to communicate it through images, written words, and speech.

I have had many diverse jobs that all required taking information and packaging it for communication.

I am interested in 15-minute cities, low-carbon technology, and architecture that lifts your mood.

I am currently taking a Technical Communication and Marketing Communication foundation course with Our Best Words (Tichtov Tadrich Tovil). With this course, I will harness all my skills.

I live in Northern Israel, in Nahariya by the coast.  I enjoy cycling, and you can often find me on my bike somewhere along this coast.
